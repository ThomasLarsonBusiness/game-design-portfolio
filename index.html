                                I am a 2023 RIT Graduate with a Bachelors in Game Design and Development. I have worked with several teams as a developer, sound designer, 
                                and QA tester, working together to develop video games for both PC and Switch. Currently I am seeking full time employment as either a engineer 
                                or a QA tester.

                            <!--Description of Project-->
                            This project was a personal project that I began to work on after graduating as a way to teach myself how to work in the game engine Godot. The basic 
                            goal of the game is to survive a shift working at a nuclear reactor that is constantly having elements fail, from pipe networks failing to simple doors 
                            failing. Through this project I learned how Godot works as an engine, including how to structure scripts and nodes to make use of the signal system that 
                            Godot has and how to organize scripts and data. I also created a tool using the same engine that allows me to create puzzles for this project, as the win 
                            condition of the project is to complete a puzzle involving connecting houses to the reactor. This tool let me create a puzzle, save its data as JSON, and 
                            then load it into the main project as a working puzzle.

                            Compete against your friends while running from a maliciously inclined goat! That Damn Goat is a splitscreen multiplayer
                            party game developed by a team of students at RIT, lead by a team of RIT faculty for PC and Switch. In this game, players compete in a variety of gamemodes
                            across a variety of maps, all while a goat does everything in its power to create chaos amongst the players. For this project my role was 
                            sound designer, composer, and QA analyst, responsible for creating sound effects and music for the project, as well as implementing audio
                            assets through Wwise. As a QA analyst, I was responsible for checking incoming merge requests to make sure that new updates worked as
                            intended as well as not breaking any other element of the project, both on PC and Switch.

                            <!--Description of Project-->
                            This project during my time in a Rich Media Web App Development class at RIT. In this project, I was tasked to use express.js to create an 
                            interesting and engaging web app along side React.js for the front end and using MongoDB as the database for the back end. The website I 
                            created was designed to be a web app where a user could create an account and, using this account, upload songs of there own and like the 
                            songs of other users. Even when not logged in, visiters could browse the homepage, search for songs and users on the site, and view other 
                            users profiles.

                            If I were to take this project further, my first goal would be to convert the whole web app into a single page application. This has many 
                            advantages both in terms of server organization and how the information gets displayed, but the biggest goal this step would lead to is 
                            creating an audio bar at the bottom of the page that continues to play the audio file the user selected to play even when switching from 
                            the homepage to a user's page. After that, I would start looking into improving the bios of the user to allow a user to create a more 
                            personalized page as well as additional features such as playlists, uploading multiple songs as albums, etc. Finally, I would want to take 
                            another deep look at the styling for the whole website and see what steps I could take to improve how the view is presented to a user.

                            This was a project I made while in IGME 430, learning NodeJS and the HTTP library. This website is a squadron creator for the board game 
                            X-Wing Tabletop Miniatures, a game where players take turns piloting a squadron of ships from the Star Wars universe trying to out-dogfight 
                            their opponent. This website lets users create a new squadron and edit the pilots inside of that sqadron.The data I am using comes from a NPM 
                            package, linked here:

                            This data is stored for half an hour, as after half an hour the webserver restarts and at this point we had not learned how to use a 
                            database.

                            Travel through an ancient china impacted by the discovery and development of arcane alchemy. Ao Shu Spellslinger is an 
                            isometric action-adventure developed by a team of students from RIT and the Art Center College of Design in California. 
                            In the game the player explores the magically altered landscapes of China and utilizes the tools that came about from the 
                            introduction of alchemy to fight back against those who would use this new power for nefarious purposes. I was a programmer 
                            on this team, whose sole focus was on developing the player controller and the aspects related to that, ranging from movement 
                            to combat to interactions with elements in the environment.

                            and Web App Development 1 class I took in the fall of 2021. This project makes use of the canvas and audio elements native to 
                            HTML and uses them to create a bullet hell game. The game uses the audio element to play the background music and to create 
                            bars along the top and bottom of the canvas element to represent the lanes of fire. The fetch API is also used to load in 
                            information pertaining to the difficulty of the game.

                            Search for your favorite books or see what books other people are reading! This app was the first project for my Rich Media 
                            Web App Developent 1 class and had us using multiple new tools and concepts. This app makes use of the Bulma library and 
                            Google's Books API to create and app that we and other users would find an actual use for. This website uses Google Books API 
                            to search for books and allows for users to save these books to two different lists, based on whether they have read them or not.

                            Tiny Little Kingdoms is a 2 to 4 player strategy game set in the world of Ethshar. It takes inspiration from games like Risk
                            with its mechanics of moving armies across the world board and Inis with a drafting phase of special cards. The game round 
                            takes place over 3 phase: drafting, planning, and execution. During the drafting phase players select a card from a pile before 
                            passing that pile onto the next player. Then players will place the cards they collect in a specific order during the planning 
                            phase, which determines the order they are used in during the execution phase.

                            Play the classic game of Othello, place your pieces and outsmart your opponent to have your color the most prevalent on the 
                            board. Othello is the third project I worked on for Intro to Game Web Tech and was my first experience using Pixi.JS and 
                            howler.JS. This site allows for two people to play through the game of Othello, with players placing tokens on the board 
                            trying to flip other tokens to their color.

                            Error 404 is a class project that I did in a team of 4 during my Game Development and Algorithmic Problem Solving class in 
                            the Spring of 2020. It is a 2D platforming game where you, the player, are trying to traverse the level and reach the opening
                            at the right edge of the screen while collecting coins and dodging spike traps. My focus in this project was to design and test
                            the levels in the game and to develop the code used to save and load the level design into the game. This is also my first ever
                            finished game!
